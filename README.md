## General Overview of the Project

The Matching Game 

- The user will be given a webpage that dispays 16 cards facedown that all have an image. When the user clicks two of the cards, they will flip over and display the image. If the images are not a match, they will turn over and the user will have another chance to select two more cards. If the cards are a match,, they will dissapear and the user will continue the game until all the cards are gone.
